- **CPL_Document**: Manages documents associated with CPL applications.
- **Application_History**: Tracks the history of changes to CPL applications.

## Integration Design

1. **Email Integration (SES)**

   - Purpose: Send notifications to applicants and staff
   - Integration Method: AWS SDK for Node.js to interact with SES
   - Data Flow: Application server sends email content and recipient info to SES

2. **Document Storage Integration (S3)**

   - Purpose: Store and retrieve CPL-related documents
   - Integration Method: AWS SDK for Node.js to interact with S3
   - Data Flow:
     - Upload: Client sends document to server, server uploads to S3
     - Retrieval: Server requests document from S3, sends to client

3. **Authentication Service**

   - Purpose: Manage user authentication and authorization
   - Integration Method: Custom authentication service or third-party service like Auth0
   - Data Flow: Client sends credentials, auth service validates and returns token

4. **Reporting Tools Integration**

   - Purpose: Generate advanced reports and visualizations
   - Integration Method: Server-side integration with reporting library (e.g., D3.js)
   - Data Flow: Server queries database, generates report using library, sends to client

5. **Legacy System Integration (if applicable)**

   - Purpose: Import existing CPL data from legacy systems
   - Integration Method: Custom ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts
   - Data Flow: ETL script extracts data from legacy system, transforms to new schema, loads into new database

6. **API Integration for External Services**
   - Purpose: Allow authorized external services to access CPL data
   - Integration Method: RESTful API with authentication
   - Data Flow: External service authenticates, makes API requests, server responds with data

By implementing these integrations, the CPL Database system will be able to efficiently communicate with external services, manage documents, send notifications, and provide robust reporting capabilities while maintaining data security and integrity.
