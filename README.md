2. **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers for high availability.
3. **Web Server**: Nginx servers to handle static content and route requests.
4. **Application Server**: Node.js with Express.js, handling business logic and API requests.
5. **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage.
6. **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
7. **S3 Bucket**: For storing uploaded documents and generated reports.
8. **SES (Simple Email Service)**: For sending email notifications.
9. **Admin Dashboard**: Separate React application for system administration.

    USER ||--o{ CPL_APPLICATION : creates
    USER ||--o{ CPL_DOCUMENT : uploads
    CPL_APPLICATION ||--o{ CPL_DOCUMENT : has
    CPL_APPLICATION ||--o{ APPLICATION_HISTORY : logs

    USER {
        UUID id PK
        string username
        string password_hash
        string email
        enum role
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }

    CPL_APPLICATION {
        UUID id PK
        string applicant_name
        string applicant_email
        string applicant_phone
        enum status
        date submission_date
        date decision_date
        text notes
        UUID created_by FK
        UUID updated_by FK
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }

    CPL_DOCUMENT {
        UUID id PK
        UUID application_id FK
        enum document_type
        string document_url
        UUID uploaded_by FK
        timestamp uploaded_at
    }

    APPLICATION_HISTORY {
        UUID id PK
        UUID application_id FK
        enum action
        text details
        UUID performed_by FK
        timestamp timestamp
    }
```

This data model represents the core entities in the CPL Database system:

- **User**: Represents system users with different roles (Admin, Manager, Staff).
- **CPL_Application**: Stores information about CPL applications.
- **CPL_Document**: Manages documents associated with CPL applications.
- **Application_History**: Tracks the history of changes to CPL applications.

## Integration Design

1. **Email Integration (SES)**

   - Purpose: Send notifications to applicants and staff
   - Integration Method: AWS SDK for Node.js to interact with SES
   - Data Flow: Application server sends email content and recipient info to SES

2. **Document Storage Integration (S3)**

   - Purpose: Store and retrieve CPL-related documents
   - Integration Method: AWS SDK for Node.js to interact with S3
   - Data Flow:
     - Upload: Client sends document to server, server uploads to S3
     - Retrieval: Server requests document from S3, sends to client

3. **Authentication Service**

   - Purpose: Manage user authentication and authorization
   - Integration Method: Custom authentication service or third-party service like Auth0
   - Data Flow: Client sends credentials, auth service validates and returns token

4. **Reporting Tools Integration**

   - Purpose: Generate advanced reports and visualizations
   - Integration Method: Server-side integration with reporting library (e.g., D3.js)
   - Data Flow: Server queries database, generates report using library, sends to client

5. **Legacy System Integration (if applicable)**

   - Purpose: Import existing CPL data from legacy systems
   - Integration Method: Custom ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts
   - Data Flow: ETL script extracts data from legacy system, transforms to new schema, loads into new database

6. **API Integration for External Services**
   - Purpose: Allow authorized external services to access CPL data
   - Integration Method: RESTful API with authentication
   - Data Flow: External service authenticates, makes API requests, server responds with data

By implementing these integrations, the CPL Database system will be able to efficiently communicate with external services, manage documents, send notifications, and provide robust reporting capabilities while maintaining data security and integrity.
